        <h1>Who are We ?</h1>
        <p>BPM, short fot British Punk Music, is a music label located in London, United Kingdom. We are a new label but our focus lies on real, old skool punk music.
            All of BPM's releases are categorized as old skool punk, blending the rebellious and independent attitude of early punk rock with a modern touch.
            The first wave of punk rock was aggressively modern, distancing itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 70's rock. In its initial form, a lot of 60's stuff was innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, what happens is that people who could not hold a candle to the likes of Hendrix started noodling away.
            Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere. By 1973, people knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock 'n' roll.</p>
